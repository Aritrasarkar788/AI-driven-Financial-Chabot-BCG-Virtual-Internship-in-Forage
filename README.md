# AI-driven-Financial-Chabot-BCG-Virtual-Internship-in-Forage
# The AI-driven financial chatbot project by Aritra Sarkar, developed as part of a BCG virtual internship through Forage, assists users with financial queries using a rule-based logic system. The chatbot prompts users to select a company from a list (Microsoft, Tesla, Apple) and provides financial data for the fiscal years 2021 to 2023. It responds to specific queries such as total revenue and average cash flow growth rates, offering a user-friendly interface for accessing financial information. This project showcases Aritra's proficiency in artificial intelligence and financial analytics.
